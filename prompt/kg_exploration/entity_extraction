        }
        @Terminology {
            @Terms API entity: An Application Programming Interface, or its abbreviation, possesses a fully qualified name (fqn) in the standard library.
        }
    }
    @ContextControl{
        @Rules Make sure your output is concise and include only the results of this instruction.
        @Rules Strictly follow the format given in the instruction to output the results.
    }
    @Instruction Extract API entity{
        @InputVariable{
            text: ${text}$
        }
        @Commands Based on the definition of API entity terminology, extract the API entities existing in the text.
        @OutputVariable{
            ${entities}$
        }
        @Rules The part of speech for API entities in the text should be nouns.
        @Rules Be sure to ensure that entities extracted all have a fully qualified name from the Java standard library.
        @Rules Do not treat variable names or instance references as API entities.
        @Rules The output API entities should not be noun phrases and must not contain spaces.
        @Rules Do not split a complete entity into two parts. For example, do not split Predicate.test() into "Predicate" and "test()" because Predicate.test() is itself a complete entity.
