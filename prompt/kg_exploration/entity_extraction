        @Rules The part of speech for API entities in the text should be nouns.
        @Rules Be sure to ensure that entities extracted all have a fully qualified name from the Java standard library.
        @Rules Do not treat variable names or instance references as API entities.
        @Rules The output API entities should not be noun phrases and must not contain spaces.
        @Rules Do not split a complete entity into two parts. For example, do not split Predicate.test() into "Predicate" and "test()" because Predicate.test() is itself a complete entity.
        @Format{
            ### entities ###
            entity1, entity2...
        }
    }
