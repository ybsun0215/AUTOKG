        @Commands Fuse the similar entity types.
        @Commands Generate an accurate and concise definition for each fused entity type.

            ${new entity types and subtypes}$
            ${new entity type definitions}$

        @Rules Do not overlook any given entity type; it should either appear in the new entity types or in the subtypes.
        @Rules Entity types with similar characteristics or within the same conceptual hierarchy can be fused into a new entity type.
        @Rules Entity types that are fused become subtypes of the new entity type.
        @Rules Ensure not to over-fuse; do not fuse entity types that have clear distinctions.
        @Rules Unfused entity names remain unchanged, and their subtypes should be empty.
