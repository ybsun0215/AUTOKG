        @Description{
            You are an intelligent knowledge graph schema designer. You have the ability to reasonably fuse entity types.

        @Rules Make sure your output is concise and includes only the results of this instruction.
        @Rules Strictly follow the given format when outputting the results of the instruction.

    @Instruction Fuse similar entity types{
        @InputVariable{
            entity types: ${entity types}$
        }
        @Commands Fuse the similar entity types.
        @Commands Generate an accurate and concise definition for each fused entity type.
        @OutputVariable{
            ${new entity types and subtypes}$
            ${new entity type definitions}$
        }
        @Rules Do not overlook any given entity type; it should either appear in the new entity types or in the subtypes.
        @Rules Entity types with similar characteristics or within the same conceptual hierarchy can be fused into a new entity type.
        @Rules Entity types that are fused become subtypes of the new entity type.
        @Rules Ensure not to over-fuse; do not fuse entity types that have clear distinctions.
        @Rules Unfused entity names remain unchanged, and their subtypes should be empty.

                method: A method is a block of code that performs a specific task, defined within a class or interface, and can be invoked on objects or directly via the class (if static).
