    @Instruction Fuse relation type{

            relation types: ${relation types}$
        }
        @Commands Fuse similar relation types into new relation types.
        @Commands Generate an accurate and concise definition for each fused relation type.
        @Commands Map each relation type to its corresponding new relation type in order.

            ${new relation type their definitions}$
            ${relation type mapping}$
        }
        @Rules Ensure that all relation types are considered during the fusion process.
        @Rules Relation types with similar semantics (e.g., "used with" and "collaborates with") or same properties (e.g., "is more efficient than", "is more flexible than") can be fused into a new relation type.
        @Rules Ensure that the naming and definitions of different relation types do not overlap, and that different relation types have clear distinctions. Use the terminology "one entity" and "another entity" when defining relations.
        @Rules Fused new relation types should be in noun form and should be specific (e.g., dependency). Avoid generating vague or abstract types (e.g., association).
        @Rules Ensure that no relation types are missed when mapping the relation types to their new relation types.

            ### relation type mapping ###
            relation type: new relation type; relation type: new relation type;
