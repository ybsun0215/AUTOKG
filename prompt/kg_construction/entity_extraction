    @Instruction Extract entity{
		@InputVariable{
			text: ${text}$
			entity types and their definitions: ${entity types and their definitions}$
		}
		@Commands Extract API entities from the text based on the given entity types and definitions.
		@OutputVariable{
			${entities with types}$
		}
        @Rules Ensure that all entities matching the given type are extracted. Specifically, words containing '()' are most likely API entities.
        @Rules The output API entities should not include any parameters, such as (*) and <*>. Do not treat keywords or variables as API entities.
        @Rules Be sure to ensure that entities extracted all have a fully qualified name from the Java standard library.
        @Rules An API entity should be treated as a complete word (splitting by spaces) and should not be divided into separate parts. For example, do not split Predicate.test() into "Predicate" and "test()".
		@Format{
		    ### entities with types ###
