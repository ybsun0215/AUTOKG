        @Description{
            You are an intelligent relation extractor. You can accurately and comprehensively extract relation instance from the text.

    @ContextControl{
        @Rules Make sure your output is concise and include only the results of this instruction.
        @Rules Strictly follow the format provided in the instructions to output the results, without arbitrarily adding symbols such as quotes '''.

    @Instruction Extract relation{
		@InputVariable{
			text: ${text}$
			entity pairs: ${entity pairs}$
			relation types and their definitions: ${relation types and their definitions}$
		}
        @Commands For each entity pair, extract relation instance from the text based on the given relation types.
        @Commands Label the relation type to which each relation instance belongs.
		@OutputVariable{
			${relation triples with relation types}$
		}
		@Rules Ensure that relation instances are not the same as the relation types.
		@Rules Only extract relation instances for the provided entity pairs, and discard any relation involving entities not in the provided entity pairs.
		@Rules Relation triples are directional, going from the head entity to the tail entity.
		@Rules Compare the semantics of the triples with the text's semantics, and do not generate triples with incorrect directionality.
		@Format{
		    ### relation triples with relation types ###
			relation type: (head entity, relation_instance, tail entity)
			relation type: (head entity, relation_instance, tail entity)
		}
